# Face Verification

In this repo Face Verification is done using Facenet's unified embeding for Facial Recognition to extract 128-dimensional vector representing 
the salient features of the input image. The 128-dimensional vector is extracted from a ground truth Image that is stored in a database and compared to embedding of faces in a 
the input image to determine whether the face is the same as the any of the faces/images in the database.
